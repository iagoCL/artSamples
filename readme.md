# Art Samples - Iago Calvo Lista

My main skill set is as a programer and not an artist, however this repository contain some samples of digital art that I have created as university courseworks and to be used as example in some of my other projects.

## Church

A simple 3D model of a church, a plain color version was used as base and then different textures were baked for each part.

## Preacher

A 3d character of a preacher, it was inspired by similar character to have resemble a rock star. It has a simple texture and Unwrapping and a character skeleton has also been created using [Mixamo](mixamo.com/#/).

## Texture pack

Some textures created to be used in 3d models, most examples are tileable textures. All are based on pictures taken by myself or were created form zero, in all cases the original photograph and the psd file are given. Most had a provisional bump map created using an automatic filter.
